/**
 * RegeneratesCache
 *
 * This trait allows an object to be saved to the cache but avoiding data-races.
 *
 * The usage is simple: use `cache()->invalidate()` from the object to mark the
 * moment the object is no longer equal to the cache. Once ready to store, use
 * `cache()->regenerate()` to put a copy into the cache only if it's fresher.
 *
 *     $object->foo = bar;
 *     $object->cache()->invalidate();
 *
 *     // ...
 *
 *     $object->cache()->regenerate(); // Store a copy in the cache.
 *
 * If the object was not marked as invalid, or the data is not fresh, it won't
 * be stored into the cache, unless you force the regeneration.
