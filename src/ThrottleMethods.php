/**
 * ThrottleMethods
 *
 * This trait allows to rate limit a given action inside the object by a given key. It
 * returns the object instance instead of the result of the call.
 *
 *     $object->throttle(60, 1)->heavilyComputational($parameters);
 *
 * Alternatively, you can pass a callable to the limit that will be executed if there are
 * too many hits for the action. The callable receives the object as first as parameter
 * and the ActionRateLimiter as second parameter, where you can use the Rate Limiter.
 *
 *     $object->throttle(60, 1, function ($object, $limiter) {
 *         $limiter->throttlerClear('heavilyComputational');
 *         $object->doSomethingElse();
 *     })->heavilyComputational($parameters);
 *
 * If you need granular control on the cache key, use the "for()" method with the key:
 *
 *     $object->for($request->ip())->throttle(60, 1)->heavilyComputational($parameters);
 *
 * If this trait collides with another method in your class, you can import the trait and
 * change method name to another:
 *
 *     class Collides
 *     {
 *         use ThrottleMethods {
 *             for as throttleFor;
 *         };
 *
 *         // ...
 *     }
