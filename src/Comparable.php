/**
 * Comparable
 *
 * This trait allows an instance to be compared to a list of items and check if the comparison
 * returns true or false. By default, it checks the current object is an instance of the them.
 *
 * For example, you can check if the object is an instance of a given interface.
 *
 *     $this->isAnyOf([Renderable::class, Htmlable::class]);
 *
 * You can also create your own comparison with a callback that accepts the current object,
 * the item being compared to, and its key.
 *
 *     $this->isAnyOf([1, 2, 3], function ($comparable, $compared, $key) {
 *         return $comparable->timesSaved() === $comparable;
 *     });
 *
 * Alternatively, you can use the `isNoneOf` method to check if none of the comparisons is
 * successful, using the same syntax.
 *
 *     $this->isNoneOf([Renderable::class, Htmlable::class]);
 *
 *     $this->isNoneOf([1, 2, 3], function ($comparable, $compared, $key) {
 *         return $comparable->timesSaved() === $comparable;
 *     });
 *
 * Finally, you can get the array key of the compared item if is successful, otherwise it
 * will return `false`:
 *
 *     $result = $this->whichOf(['foo' => 'bar', 'baz' => 'quz'], function ($comparable, $compared) {
 *         return $comparable->name === $compared;
 *     });
 *
 *     echo $result; // "foo"
