/**
 * HasSlug
 *
 * This trait is just a handy collection of methods to allow any models to be routed by the "slug" on requests.
 * You'll need to set what text from the model use as a base to convert to an slug and, in your table, add the
 * "slug" string column with an unique for faster retrieval. The slug is generated automatically when saving.
 *
 * If you want to copy-paste the migration needed to your sluggable table model, use this:
 *
 *     $table->string('slug')->unique();
 *
 * To disable routing the model by the slug property, you can disable it using `routeBySlug`:
 *
 *    protected $routeBySlug = false;
 *
 * The above will use the parent Eloquent Model default routing key.
