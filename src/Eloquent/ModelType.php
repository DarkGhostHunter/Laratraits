/**
 * Model Type
 *
 * Assume you have a table that holds different types of audio files: podcasts, songs, snippets, etc. With
 * this trait you can set a column that will hold the type, while these models extend the same base model
 * with common properties and methods. This trait will add the scope and the type automatically to each.
 *
 *     class Color extends Model
 *     {
 *         protected $table = 'colors';
 *
 *         // ..
 *     }
 *
 *     class Red extends Color
 *     {
 *         use ModelType;
 *     }
 *
 *     class Blue extends Color
 *     {
 *         use ModelType;
 *     }
 *
 * When you save "Red" or "Blue" models, your table would look like this:
 *
 *     | colors                              |
 *     | id | type | created_at | updated_at |
 *     |----|------|------------|------------|
 *     | 1  | red  | 2020-04-01 | 2020-04-01 |
 *     | 2  | blue | 2020-04-01 | 2020-04-01 |
 *
 * If you constantly query the column type, is recommended to (at least) create an index for it.
 *
 *     $table->index('type');
 *
 * You can also go wild with compound primary keys, if necessary.
 *
 *     $table->dropPrimary('id');
 *     $table->primary(['id', 'type']);
