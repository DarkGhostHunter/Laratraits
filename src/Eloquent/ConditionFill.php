/**
 * ConditionFill
 *
 * This trait allows a model to be filled depending on a condition, allowing to chain methods.
 *
 * By default, if a condition is truthy, the attribute will be filled with the condition value.
 *
 *     $model->fillWhen($user->is_admin, 'read_only')->save();
 *     $model->fillUnless($request->isBot(), 'moderated')->save();
 *
 * You can also include a value to be set as the attribute:
 *
 *     $model->fillWhen($user->is_vip, 'cleared_at', now());
 *
 * The condition parameter also accepts a callable to resolve.
 *
 *     $model->fillWhen(fn() => return true, 'foo', 'bar');
