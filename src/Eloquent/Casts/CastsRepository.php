 * CastRepository
 *
 * This Cast allows a column on the model with complex arrayable data to ve a Repository.
 * This allows the property to be accessed like a config-style set of values.
 *
 *     protected $casts = [
 *         'config' => CastRepository::class,
 *     ];
 *
 * Then, in your code, you can use the Repository methods.
 *
 *     $model->config->get('schedule.days');
