/**
 * CastEnumerable
 *
 * This class allows a Model to cast an "enum" property into a Enumerable instance with its own
 * list of available states. Because this class needs the possible states declared beforehand
 * this is made an abstract class you will need to extend with the states you want to have.
 *
 *     class WeatherEnumerable extends CastEnumerable
 *     {
 *         protected $current = 'sunny';
 *
 *         protected $states = ['sunny', 'cloudy', 'rainy', 'windy', 'stormy', 'snowy'];
 *
 *         // ...
 *      }
 *
 * Then, you can create a custom casting your Model attributes:
 *
 *     protected $casts = [
 *         'weather' => WeatherEnumerable::class,
 *     ];
