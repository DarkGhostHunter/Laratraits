/**
 * EncryptsJson
 *
 * This trait allows to serialize the model as an encrypted JSON string automatically.
 *
 *     $model = new Model(['foo' => 'bar']);
 *
 *     echo $model->toJson(); // "eyJpdiI6IlZBRVJ5WlI0bUJPNzkxWHRVcj..."
 *
 * Encrypting the model JSON representation can be useful to transmit it or store it without
 * giving the model properties away. You can also restore a model instance using the static
 * method `fromEncryptedJson()` with the previously encrypted JSON string, and prepare it.
 *
 *     protected function afterJsonDecryption()
 *     {
 *         $this->received_at = now();
 *     }
 *
 *     $model = Model::fromEncryptedJson($json);
