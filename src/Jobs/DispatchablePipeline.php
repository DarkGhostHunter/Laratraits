/**
 * Dispatchable Pipeline
 *
 * This class is in charge of holding the Pipeline and the "passable" thing, and execute the pipeline once
 * this Job is dispatched. This Job instance is used when you add the "DispatchesPipeline" trait in your
 * custom pipelines. Like all Jobs in Laravel, this is will return void once handled by the dispatcher.
