 * RegisterBladeExtensions
 *
 * This traits allows you to register multiple Blade extensions in just a few arrays.
 * The Blade compiler uses **callables** for directives and the custom if statements
 * so you will need to use public static methods and them as class@method notation.
 *
 *     protected $directives = [
 *         'package-alert' => 'App\Blade\Directives\AlertComponent@alert',
 *         'status-now' => 'App\Blade\Directives\Status@now',
 *     ]
 *
 *     protected $if = [
 *         'cloud' => 'App\Blade\Conditions\Cloud',
 *         'local' => 'App\Blade\Conditions\Local@condition',
 *     ]
 *
 *     protected $include = [
 *         'input' => 'includes.input'
 *         'authavatar' => 'includes.auth_avatar'
 *     ]
 *
 *     public function boot()
 *     {
 *         $this->registerBladeExtensions();
 *
 *         // ...
 *     }
