 * RegistersObservers
 *
 * This traits allows you to register multiple eloquent events by just issuing an array
 * into your EventServiceProvider, that your boot method should hook up manually:
 *
 *     protected $observers = [
 *         'App\User' => 'App\Observers\UserObserver',
 *         'App\Post' => ['App\Observers\PublicationObserver', 'App\Observers\HomeObserver']
 *     ]
 *
 *     public function boot()
 *     {
 *         $this->registerObservers();
 *
 *         // ...
 *     }
