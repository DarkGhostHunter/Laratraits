 * all migrations properly named located in the default `database/migrations`
 * directory, and it will proceed to register each of them as publishable.
 *
 *     public function boot(): void
 *     {
 *         $this->publishMigrations();
 *
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *
 * The developer will be able to publish these files using the "migration" tag.
 *
 * Migrations names must follow this naming convention:
 *
 *     0000_00_00_000000_{snake_case_class_name}.php
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *     0000_00_00_000000_create_foo_table.php
