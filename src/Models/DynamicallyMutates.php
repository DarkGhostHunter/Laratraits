/**
 * Dynamically Mutates
 *
 * This trait allows a column to be mutated dynamically depending on a given value. For example, column "foo"
 * may contain a value that can be a boolean, array or string, while column "bar" contains its type. With
 * this, you can create an mutator/accessor to dynamically cast the value into its native data type.
