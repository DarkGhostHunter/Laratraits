/**
 * Neighbour Records trait
 *
 * This trait will allow you to conveniently get the previous and next record in a performing-way. This only
 * returns the primary key of these neighbour records, but you can override the way the list is queried to
 * the database, and even if it should be cached or not, which is totally recommended for large tables.
