 * Model Type
 *
 * Assume you have a table that holds different types of audio files: podcasts, songs, snippets, etc. With
 * this trait you can set a column that will hold the type, while these models extend the same base model
 * with common properties and methods. This trait will add the scope and the type automatically to each.
