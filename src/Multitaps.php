/**
 * Multitaps
 *
 * This is a hacky way to "tap" indefinitely the current class instance. To stop multitaping, you can use
 * the "$target" public property to access the underlying object, or append "AndUntap" to any method.
 * This also allows for an optional callable to be used when starting the multitaping in here.
 *
 *     $result = $class->multitap()->foo()->bar($qux)->quzAndUntap();
 *
 * You can also use a callable to call before starting the multitap.
 *
 *     $result = $class->multitap(function ($class) {
 *         $class->doSomethingBeforeMultitap();
 *     })->foo()->barAndUntap();
