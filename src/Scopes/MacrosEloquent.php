 * Throttles Requests

 * This trait allows you to extend the Eloquent Builder instance using local macros, which are macros but
 * only valid for the instance itself instance of globally. This cycles through all the scope methods,
 * filters only those that starts with "macro", executes them receiving a Closure, and adds them.
