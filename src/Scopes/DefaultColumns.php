/**
 * Default Columns

 * This scopes injects a "select" into the Eloquent Query Builder with a given list of columns, which can be later
 * be overridden by the query itself. This allows the queried record to only select some columns instead of all,
 * which without can become problematic when tidying up memory consumption and data retrieved for each Model.
