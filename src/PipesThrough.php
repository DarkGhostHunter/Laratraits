/**
 * Pipes Through
 *
 * This trait is fairly simple: takes the instance and sends it through a given Pipeline, instantiated by
 * the Service Container, and returns a result (hopefully the same instance). You can change the pipes,
 * the Closure to receive the result, the default methods to use, and even the Pipeline class itself.
