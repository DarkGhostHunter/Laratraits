/**
 * PipesThrough
 *
 * This trait is fairly simple: takes the object and sends it through a Pipeline and returns a
 * result. You can include the pipes as an array of classes or callables. You can also create
 * a custom Pipeline class with your own pipes for most simplicity and override the methods.
 *
 *     // Pipe the class immediately.
 *     $result = $class->pipe();
 *
 *     // Pipe the class asynchronously.
 *     $class->dispatchPipeline([
 *         PipeFoo::class,
 *         PipeBar::class,
 *     ]);
